One of the operating systems primary functions is to create a GUI, graphical user interface, for the the user.
The GUI is what most people think of when they think of different operating systems, it is what you see and interact with when using the system.
Without the GUI all the user commands would have to be input into the command line in order to be run.
The GUI allows for ease of access and use for the user to perform almost all commands.
